# kafka cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/kafka-cookbook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/kafka-cookbook)

Installs Kafka `v0.8.0`, and probably any newer versions.

Based on the Kafka cookbook released by WebTrends (thanks!), but with a few
notable differences:

* supports both source and binary releases.
* does not depend on runit cookbook.
* does not depend on zookeeper cookbook, thus it will not search for nodes with
  a specific role or such, that is left up to you to decide.
* only tested on Vagrant boxes.
* intended to be used by wrapper cookbooks.

## Requirements

This cookbook does not depend on any specific cookbooks, but it requires that
java is installed on the system, thus the `java` cookbook is recommended.

Ruby 1.9.3+ and Chef 11.6.0+.

### Platform

* Amazon Linux
* CentOS 6.5
* Debian 7.4
* Fedora 20
* Ubuntu 14.04

Might work on other platforms / versions, but these are the ones that are
included in `.kitchen.yml`, so YMMV.

## Attributes

In order to keep the README in some kind of manageable state (and thus in sync
with attributes), attributes are documented inline (in the `attribute` files
that is).

Attributes concerning configuring of a Kafka broker are to be set under the
`broker` namespace, and one can choose which ever syntax they prefer the most,
the following are all valid ways to define broker configuration:

```ruby
node.default.kafka.broker[:log_dirs] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default.kafka.broker['log.dirs'] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default.kafka.broker.log.dirs = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
node.default[:kafka][:broker][:log][:dirs] = %w[/tmp/kafka-logs]
```

A warning regarding the "dotted" notation, it doesn't play very well when
setting attributes like `default.replication.factor` or
`fetch.purgatory.purge.interval.requests` due to fairly obvious reasons
(`default` and `fetch` are also methods).

Refer to the official documentation for the version of Kafka that you're
installing.
Documentation for the latest release can be found [over here](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#brokerconfigs).

## Recipes

This section describes the different recipes that are available.

### default

Includes either `source` or `binary` recipe depending on what
`node.kafka.install_method` is set to (`:source, :binary`).

### source

Downloads, compiles and installs Kafka from the official source releases.
Defaults to installing `v0.8.1.1` of Kafka.

### binary

Downloads and installs Kafka from the official binary releases.
Defaults to installing `v0.8.1.1` of Kafka.

### Controlling restart of kafka servers in a cluster

Any changes made to Kafka configuration, will result in restart of Kafka server. 
If this cookbook is run as a daemon on all the nodes of a kafka cluster, this can
result in the all the kafka servers being brought time at the sametime resulting
in unavailability. 

If unavailability is an issue, the cookbook provides an option to implement custom
logic to control the restart of kafka servers so that all the instances in a cluster
are not stopped at the same time. For e.g. the custom logic can be something like a node
 can restart if it can acquire a lock.

By default the resources in the recipe [`` _coordinate.rb ``](https://github.com/mthssdrbrg/kafka-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/_coordinate.rb) in this cookbook performs the 
start/restart of `` kafka `` service. If a custom logic need to be implemented, this recipe 
can be replaced with a new recipe and the recipe name need to be updated in the attribute `` default.kafka.start_coordination.recipe ``. 
The only requrirement is that the new recipe need to have the `` ruby_block 'coordinate-kafka-start' `` 
as the first resource. The following is a sample recipe which can replace the default `` _coordinate.rb ``.

```
    ruby_block "coordinate-kafka-start" do
       block do
          Chef::Log.info (" Custom recipe to coordinate Kafka start is used")
        end
        action :create
        notifies :create, 'ruby_block[restart_coordination]', :delayed
     end
     ruby_block "restart_coordination" do
       block do
          Chef::Log.info ("Need to implement the process to coordinate the restart process like using ZK")
       end
       action :nothing
       notifies :restart, 'service[kafka]', :delayed
     end
     service 'kafka' do
        provider kafka_init_opts[:provider]
        supports start: true, stop: true, restart: true, status: true
        action kafka_service_actions
     end
     ruby_block "restart_coordination_cleanup" do
       block do
          Chef::Log.info ("Implement any cleanup logic required after restart like releasing locks")
       end
       action :nothing
     end
```
